# https://github.com/rslavin/slack2discord/commit/4938c98292041b95210af0e544a4d61788c2c3c9
* use rich text embeds for hyperlinks
* reupload attachments to Discord rather than using Slack link
* mention channels correctly
* when adding just one embed, use singular embed, so that it has a cleaner look
* fix some HTML entities in output, e.g. &amp; etc

Combination of work by Yamiko & saizai.
